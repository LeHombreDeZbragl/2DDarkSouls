It's my second game. For this game you will need a controller(I have xbox controller and it is working just fine don't know about the others). Gameplay: movement - the left joystick , aim - right joystick, dash - right bumper, secondary weapon - left trigger. There is about 30 randomly generated rooms. There are normal rooms with enemies, rooms with treasure and one room with boss. You will spawn with one of the four secondary weapons. I have not finished it once so GLHF i guess. BTW we won't talk about the fact that there are two huge spaces on each side where you can see other rooms.
